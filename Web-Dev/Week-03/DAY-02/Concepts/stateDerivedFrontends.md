# State Derived Frontends
- To make frontends easier to code, the concept of "state" came into the picture.
- will see more of it in React.

### Three important things to focus:
    - 1. State: The variable parts of an app.
    - 2. Components: How to "render" the "state" on screen.
    - 3. Rendering: Taking the "state" and rendering it on the DOM based on the "components".
